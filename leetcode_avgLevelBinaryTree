Following is the leetcode problem - 
Average of Levels in Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Solution - 
(python)
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def averageOfLevels(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[float]:
        result, queue = [], [root]
        while queue:
            t_q, t_r = [], []
            for i in queue:
                t_r.append(i.val)
                
                if i.left:
                    t_q.append(i.left)
                    
                if i.right:
                    t_q.append(i.right)
            
            queue = t_q
            result.append(t_r)
        
        return [ sum(m)/len(m) for m in result]
